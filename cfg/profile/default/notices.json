The start times are listed below in the respective sections.*\n\n\n*We have an NA event that will be posted roughly seven hours after this thread. You may participate in this event if you wish, but for the sake of fairness and latency, EU players will have priority in joining games during this event.*\n\n\n#Community Night\n\nIt's time for the official CS:GO Reddit Community Night! Community Night is a weekly Tuesday evening event in which we play 5v5 games(10mans not scrims) with other redditors on our own 128-tick servers with competitive settings on classic maps (i.e. Active Group and older competitive maps). The night will last for a few hours, so feel free to drop in whenever you're free! ALL Ranks Welcome!   \n\n\n###When Is It?\n\nThe EU event begins four hours from this thread being posted. Community Night begins at **8:30 PM CEST** (4 hours from now), but it will be preceded by an hour of playtesting beginning at **7:30 CEST**.\n\nIf you would like weekly alerts for the start of our events, feel free to join the [Community Night Steam Group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditcommunitynights/)! Announcements are made at the minute the event starts, so you won't miss a thing.\n\n###How do I join?\n\nTo join, simply connect to our [TeamSpeak3](http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads) server and hop in the Community Night lobby to get put into a game by an admin.  Here are the server details:\n\n**Server Address**: **[ts.redditcsgo.com](ts3server://ts.redditcsgo.com)**\n\n*Note: When connecting, please include your rank at the beginning of your name like so: \"MGE-Jpon9\".*\n___\n\n#De_Waterfall Playtesting\n**[Information about playtesting](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/wiki/playtesting)**  \n\nWe are inviting everyone to join us in a play testing session for [De_Waterfall (workshop)](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=596575175)!   \n\n###How do I participate?\n\nThe details are identical to those found above for Community Night -- join the same TeamSpeak server and include your rank at the beginning of your name.  The event starts at **7:30 PM CEST** and only lasts one hour, but you have the option of continuing to play the selected map during Community Night if you can get enough people who are willing.\n\nIf you would like to be notified when the playtest starts you can join our [Playtesting Steam Group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditplaytesting).      \n\nAfter you have played a game or two on the map, please submit your feedback here in the form of a comment!  Be detailed and constructive :)  \n\n###To map makers\n\nWe are taking applications for playtesting your competitive maps.   \nIf you are interested in submitting your map complete [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1oN2U5QvAQOxdIXvtoAkSbLEL5d5DTutt3joWdhybnUg/viewform)\n\n---\n\n***Special thanks to [](https://www.pacifices.net)* for generously donating servers for the Reddit Community Nights and Playtesting.** ",

For example, we have certain scripts that would not work the same with Discord, as well as buttons inside channels to automatically join servers. Discord is great for large communities over text chat, but simply doesn't offer what we need for voice. \n\n**What happened to the NA Community Nights?**\n\n* Unfortunately, we no longer have the servers we used to use for NA community nights, and therefore have not been able to run these events in NA. Interested in donating a NA server to us for community nights? Please send us a [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/GlobalOffensive) to discuss!\n\n**Can I still play if I'm silver?**\n\n* Of course! Community nights are open to everyone, regardless of skill. We have people join of all ranks, and mods will do their best to separate players into even teams. \n\n___\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^spacer     \n---\n\n***Special thanks to /u/taffe, /u/sNapCSGO, /u/BOHverkill, and u/supergoudvis for generously donating servers for the Reddit Community Nights and [](https://www.pacifices.net) for the Teamspeak server***",
